            EMAIL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:

            PROFESSIONAL STRUCTURE:
            - Start with personalized greeting: "Dear [User/Resident/Team],"
            - Use HTML-friendly formatting that works in all email clients
            - Include a compelling subject line suggestion at the top
            - Professional signature with contact information
            - Keep under 500 words for optimal readability

            IMPORTANT DATA STRUCTURE NOTE:
            - Each result may contain building.image_url or building_image_url
            - Use these URLs to create clickable building name links
            - Room results include: room_number, building_name, and potentially building_image_url
            - Analytics results may include: building_name and building_image_url
            - Always check for the presence of image URL before creating links

            VISUAL ELEMENTS:
            - Use headers with === underlines for sections
            - Bullet points with ‚Ä¢ for lists
            - Format currency professionally: $1,500/month
            - Bold **important values** using asterisks
            - Create visual separation with line breaks
            - Use tables with | pipes | for data comparison

            HYPERLINK FORMATTING:
            - When displaying building names or "Room X - Building Name", create HTML hyperlinks if building_image_url exists
            - Format: <a href="[building_image_url]">[building_name]</a>
            - If no image URL exists, display plain text
            - Examples:
              * With URL: "<a href='https://example.com/building.jpg'> Room 101 - 1080 Folsom</a>"
              * Without URL: "Room 205 - Sunset Residences"
            - Apply to all building name mentions in the email
            - Ensure proper HTML escaping for security

            CONTENT HIERARCHY:

            Create a structured response optimized for a React-based web UI that will parse and render this data:

            Query Type: {result_type}

            {json.dumps(sample_data, indent=2)}
            
            REACT UI FORMATTING GUIDELINES:
            
            IMPORTANT: The React frontend will parse and style this response. Focus on:
            - Clean, semantic structure that React components can easily render
            - Logical content hierarchy that maps to component structure
            - Data-focused formatting (the UI will handle the visual styling)
            - Markdown syntax that React-Markdown can parse
            
            MARKDOWN FOR REACT:
            - Use standard markdown headers: # ## ### (React will style these)
            - Bold with **text** and italics with *text*
            - Lists with - or * (React will convert to proper list components)
            - Tables with proper markdown syntax (React-Table compatible)
            - Links: [text](url) format
            - NO HTML tags - only pure markdown
            - NO custom Unicode boxes/borders (React components handle containers)
            - Building links: When building_image_url exists, format as [Building Name](image_url)
            - This allows React to render as clickable links or image previews
            - Example: [1080 Folsom](https://example.com/1080-folsom.jpg)
            
            STRUCTURE FOR REACT COMPONENTS:

            üìä DATA TABLES (React-Table Ready):

            üéØ REACT COMPONENT MAPPING:
            The frontend expects these sections:
            1. Title (h1) - Will render in a PageHeader component
            2. Summary (h2) - Will render in a SummaryCard component  
            3. Results (h2) with items (h3) - Will map to ResultCard components
            4. Tables - Will render in a DataTable component
            5. Insights - Will render in an InsightsPanel component
            
            üì± RESPONSIVE CONSIDERATIONS:
            - Keep text concise (React UI will handle truncation/expansion)
            - Group related data (will render in collapsible cards)
            - Provide clear hierarchical structure
            - Use consistent formatting patterns
            
            ‚úÖ DO:
            - Use clean markdown syntax
            - Provide structured, parseable content
            - Include all relevant data fields
            - Use consistent naming for similar items
            - Format numbers with commas ($1,500 not $1500)
            
            ‚ùå DON'T:
            - Add visual decorations (emojis/unicode boxes)
            - Include UI instructions ("click here", "scroll down")
            - Use complex formatting (React handles this)
            - Add CSS or styling hints
            - Include interactive elements syntax

            - Loading skeletons
            - Sort/filter capabilities
